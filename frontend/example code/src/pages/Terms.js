          bound by (i) these Terms of Use, (ii) our Privacy Policy and Safety
          Tips, each of which is incorporated by reference into this Agreement,
          and (iii) any terms disclosed and agreed to by you if you purchase
          additional features, products or services we offer on the Service
          (collectively, this “Agreement”). If you do not accept and agree to be
          bound by all of the terms of this Agreement, please do not use the

        <p>
          We may make changes to this Agreement and to the Service from time to
          time. We may do this for a variety of reasons including to reflect
          changes in or requirements of the law, new features, or changes in
          business practices. The most recent version of this Agreement will be
          posted on the Service under Settings, and you should regularly check
          for the most recent version. The most recent version is the version
          that applies. If the changes include material changes that affect your
          rights or obligations, we will notify you in advance of the changes by
          reasonable means, which could include notification through the Service
          or via email. If you continue to use the Service after the changes
          become effective, then you agree to the revised Agreement.
